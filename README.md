# 42_CORE
This is a repository showcasing all 42 projects I've successfully completed during my 42 Core Program curriculum. All previous projects repositories have been destroyed and moved here to create a more cohesive and organized project folder.

To compile the code, run the makefile
```bash
make
```

To run the code, run the executable's name with the appropriate inputs. (Executable name is usually named after the project name)
```bash
./philo
./Fdf test_maps/42.fdf
```
