# 42_CORE
This is a repository showcasing all 42 projects I've successfully completed during my 42 Core Program curriculum. All previous projects repositories have been destroyed and moved here to create a more cohesive and organized project folder.

To compile the code, run the makefile
```bash
make
```

To run the code, run the executable's name with the appropriate inputs. (Executable name is usually named after the project name)
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
./fdf test_maps/42.fdf
```

## Fdf
This project is a 3D Wireframe Model Visualizer developed as part of the graphics branch of the 42 School curriculum. The FDF project is a graphical application written in C that visualizes 3D wireframe models from a set of 2D coordinates. It is a software development project that focuses on graphics programming, specifically in the field of rendering. The main goal of the project is to create a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape.

## Philosophers
This project implements a solution to the dining philosophers problem, providing practical experience in concurrent programming and synchronization. This project aims to solve the dining philosophers problem, which involves simulating the behavior of philosophers sitting at a round table and performing actions such as eating, thinking, and sleeping.  The challenge lies in ensuring that philosophers never starve and that careful synchronization is implemented to avoid issues like deadlock and race conditions which provides hands-on experience in implementing solutions to real-world problems in concurrent computing.
